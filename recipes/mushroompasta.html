        <h1>Spinach Mushroom Pasta</h1>
        <p>
            This one pot spinach-mushroom pasta dish comes together in a flash. It pairs well with grilled chicken 
            but is delicious with pork chops, steak, and fish too. The best part is that youâ€™ll only have one pan 
            to wash.
