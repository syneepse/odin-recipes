        <h1>how to make lasagna</h1>
        <p>
            This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch 
            tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna 
            filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd 
            cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green 
            salad and crusty garlic bread.
